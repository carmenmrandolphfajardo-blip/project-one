    Foundation became aware of the anomalous site hereby referred to as "Hill House" in 1952, after a scholarly paper by Dr. John Montague was published detailing the events of his stay in the summer of 1951. 
    Foundation personnel conducted a preliminary investigation and subsequently acquired the property from the Sanderson family.
    The site located is located 20 miles north of [REDACTED].
    Local population has been deemed a non-issue to the security of the site.
