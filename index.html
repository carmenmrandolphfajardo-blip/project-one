  <h3>Hill House c. 1909</h3>
  <h2>Excerpt from the journal of Dr. John Montague</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "The house is a most peculiar structure, with angles that seem to shift and change when one is not looking directly at them. 
    The atmosphere within is oppressive, and I have experienced several unsettling phenomena during my stay here. 
    I am convinced that the house itself is alive in some manner, and I intend to uncover its secrets."
  </p>
